# Automating Docker Deployments with Jenkins, Ansible, and GitHub

This repository demonstrates how to automate **Docker deployments** using **Jenkins**, **Ansible**, and **GitHub**. The setup ensures a continuous integration and delivery pipeline that automates the deployment process for Dockerized applications.

For a detailed guide on setting up this project, check out the full article [here](https://mahesh1215.hashnode.dev/beginners-guide-automating-docker-deployments-with-jenkins-ansible-and-github?source=more_articles_bottom_blogs).

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this project, we combine **Jenkins**, **Ansible**, and **GitHub** to create a CI/CD pipeline for automating Docker deployments. This pipeline will:

- Use **GitHub** for source code management.
- Trigger automated builds using **Jenkins**.
- Use **Ansible** for configuration management and deployment.
- Build and deploy Docker containers to an environment.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Git**
- **Docker**
- **Jenkins**
- **Ansible**

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mahesh-diwan/Devops-Project2.git
  cd Devops-Project2
  ```

2. **Docker: Build and Run the Docker Container Locally:**

  ```bash
  docker build -t my-app .
  docker run -p 8080:80 my-app
  ```

3. **Jenkins: Set Up Jenkins with the Provided Jenkinsfile to Automate the CI/CD Process.**

4. **Ansible: Configure Ansible Playbooks to Automate Deployment Tasks. Ensure that your environment is ready to use the Ansible playbooks to deploy the Docker containers.**

5. **Follow the Detailed Steps in the Guide to Fully Configure Jenkins, GitHub, and Ansible for Automated Deployments.**
